## Roku Voice is a multi-shortcut Roku controller.

Roku Voice allows you to speak to your Roku device and perform several types of actions. You can say things like, "**Launch Plex**," "**Netflix and Chill**," or "**Pause Roku**." You can perform a search in Roku with whatever keywords you like by saying something like "**Search for**" followed by the keywords. This Shortcut can also add and remove Roku devices to control, as well as Channels to launch. It uses a JSON database stored in your iCloud folder to maintain your devices and channels.
